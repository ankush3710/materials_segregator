# materials_segregator
This is our final year college project. 

The goal of this repo is to get everything in one place, easy to share and collaborate.
This repo will probably contain **all the code and ppts** required to start and complete the project from scratch.

Code files:
1. label_image.py -- exec --> $ python3 label_image.py /path/to/image 1/0 > the_data
> 1 -> capture a new image
> 0 -> use existing image

2. the_data is a text file with outputs in descending order
3. all_motor_code.py -- exec --> $ python all_motor_code.py 
4. picamera-test.py --> code used by **label_image.py**, main command *raspistill*.
5. key_bindings.txt --> all the connections from the raspberrypi to the motors.
